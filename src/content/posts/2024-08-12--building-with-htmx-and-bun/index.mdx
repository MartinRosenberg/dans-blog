## Building a Full-Stack Application with Bun, Elysia, and HTMX

Ethan Niser recently introduced the [BETH Stack](https://github.com). It stands for Bun, Elysia, Turso, HTMX which is fantastic.


### Step 1: Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justsml/bun-elysia-htmx.git
cd bun-elysia-htmx
```

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies

Once you've navigated into the project directory, install the necessary dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

Bun will automatically read the `package.json` file and install the required dependencies faster than `npm` or `yarn`.

### Step 3: Understanding the Project Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the main directories and files in the project:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **`index.ts`**: The entry point of the application where Elysia is configured.
  - **`routes/`**: Contains the route handlers for different endpoints.
  - **`views/`**: Holds the HTML templates rendered by HTMX.
- **`public/`**: Static files like CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript.
- **`bunfig.toml`**: Configuration file for Bun, similar to `package.json`.

### Step 4: Configuring Elysia

[Elysia](https://elysia.js.org/) is a lightweight and fast web framework for Bun. It’s similar to Express.js but optimized for Bun’s environment.

In the `src/index.ts` file, you’ll see how Elysia is set up:

```typescript
import Elysia from 'elysia';

const app = new Elysia();

app.get('/', ({ html }) => {
  return html('<h1>Hello from Elysia and HTMX!</h1>');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:3000`);
});
```

This basic setup creates a server that listens on port 3000 and responds with a simple HTML message when accessed at the root URL.

### Step 5: Integrating HTMX

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is a powerful library that allows you to create dynamic, interactive web pages with less JavaScript by leveraging HTML attributes.

The repository demonstrates how to use HTMX for sending HTTP requests and updating parts of the page dynamically. For example, in the `views/` directory, you might find a template file like `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Elysia + HTMX</title>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.6.1"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Elysia + HTMX Example</h1>
  <button hx-get="/api/data" hx-target="#result">Fetch Data</button>
  <div id="result"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, clicking the button triggers an HTMX `GET` request to the `/api/data` endpoint, and the response is inserted into the `div` with the ID `result`.

### Step 6: Running the Application

To run the application, simply use the following command:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

You should see output confirming that the server is running:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you’ll see the application in action. The button click will dynamically load data into the page using HTMX without requiring a full page reload.

### Step 7: Customizing and Extending

Now that you have the application up and running, you can start customizing it to suit your needs. Some potential enhancements include:

- **Adding more routes**: Extend the application by adding more API routes in the `routes/` directory.
- **Database Integration**: Connect a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to handle persistent data.
- **Styling**: Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap to improve the look and feel of the application.
- **Advanced HTMX Usage**: Implement more complex interactions with HTMX, like form submissions, real-time updates, etc.

### Conclusion

By combining Bun, Elysia, and HTMX, you get a powerful stack that leverages modern JavaScript tooling for building fast and dynamic web applications. This setup is lightweight yet extensible, making it suitable for a wide range of projects. Feel free to explore the [justsml/bun-elysia-htmx](https://github.com/justsml/bun-elysia-htmx) repository further and adapt it to your next web project!
