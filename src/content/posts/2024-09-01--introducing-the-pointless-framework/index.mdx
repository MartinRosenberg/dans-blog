## Introducing `The Pointless Framework`.

`The Pointless Framework` is about measuring `value over velocity.`

### Measure Value Over Velocity

- Leadership & Product team(s) should assign "trophy" monetary values to all tasks, as a way to declare work's relative value to the business.
  - A task worth $10,000 may be thanks to a customer who is willing to pay. Or perhaps the task saves tons in cloud costs. Maybe it's a required regulatory change that could cost the company $10,000 in fines.
  - Off-beat requests & experiments may get a better chance. A CEO can declare a task worth $10,000,000 - simply because they demand it built yesterday! This has more clarity than a `p1` or `p2` priority.
  - Better communicate priority for unsexy work and non-functional requirements. For example, cost optimizations & performance work can be awkward when written as a User Story: _"As a Marketing Director, I want to make sure we can handle the traffic when my influencer campaign (of 40 Million Followers) goes live on the 1st of next month."_ Every task doesn't need a User Story, sometimes a requirements list is more clear.
  {/* - It's not about revenue or cost. It's about the abstract value of the work to the business. */}

<p class="breakout">**Unwanted features** delivered ever faster?<br/>Rarely beats **`Value`** - delivered slow or fast!</p>

## Does Product Development need fixing?

There's a point in most growing organizations when "Engineering Velocity" becomes a metric. It's calculated by counting the number of tasks or "story points" completed in a sprint.

Velocity is a low value signal. It says **nothing about the value or quality** of the work.

{/* Who can blame leadership after **considering how "Team Velocity" graphs are presented?** In the "Big Boss" meetings, **each VP presents "real" graphs**: sales team numbers, forecasted profit/loss, and monthly active users. Then, Engineering presents a sober-looking Jira graph, which conceals these numbers are pretty unlike "hard" sales data. */}

### Not Agile Enough

The *Agile Industrial Complex* has popularized oversimplifications of the product-building process. Process "infographics" often depict simple linear sequences that never address reality.

This oversimplification can get in the way of sane project development. Even preventing the right parties from talking at the right time about the problem at hand. This leads to communication breakdowns & eventually a loss of trust. (Cue "Raising the Bar," Performance Reviews, Hiring definitely-not-your-replacements...)

It doesn’t have to be this way.

## Pointless in Practice

Imagine a world where your backlog is honestly prioritized, not by low-fi `p1, p2, p0, p00`, but a clear value estimate!

</figure>

No one is getting paid these amounts, this isn’t a contract job board. The numbers let everyone know the relative value leadership has assigned.

This empowers leadership to adjust expected values up and down - as the market changes. While this may add thrashing overhead as devs switch tasks, it’s perhaps **preferable to doing work no longer wanted.**
