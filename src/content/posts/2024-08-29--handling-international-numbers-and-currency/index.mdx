# Why localize Numbers & Currency?

Localization is a key part of making your app **feel at home in different countries.** Localization is a big topic, including language translation, date formatting, etc. But today, we'll focus on **numbers and currency.**

<p class="breakout">Nothing can feel less authentic to an international user than finding an app littered with inconsistent Local- or US-formatted numbers, dates, and phone numbers.</p>

It may be surprising to many people the big differences even between major Euro countries:

In Ireland folks expect to see `€1,234.56`, in Germany `1.234,56 €`, in France `1 234,56 €`, and compared to the US `$1,234.56`.

Note the whitespace and punctuation differences in those examples.

In this guide, we'll get a handle on how to localize numbers in our own apps.

1. [Key Terms](#key-terms)
1. [Formatting Numbers](#formatting-numbers)
1. [Formatting Currency](#formatting-currency)

## Key Terms

- Locale: describes an [Language](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php) & [Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) pair. ( `en-US` , `en-GB`, `xh-ZA`)
- Currency Code: Three letter codes from the [ISO 4217 Currency Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) identify every currency. (`EUR: Euro`, `CAD: Canadian Dollars`, `USD: US Dollars`)


Every country or territory actually has 3 ways to refer to it: a two letter code, a three letter code, and a numeric code.  (`US`, `USA`, `840`).

> Note: Locales ONLY use two letter country codes.


## Formatting Numbers

Before we get to money, let's talk numbers.

To format a number locally, we'll need a `locale` - a language + country string (`en-US`). Every `locale` defines how to format numbers.

Details like whether commas, periods, or spaces are used as separators. For example, compare several EU/Euro locales:

- Germany: `1.234.567,89`
- Ireland: `1,234,567.89`
- France: `1 234 567,89`

<details open>
  <summary>View source: JS number formatting.</summary>
  <p>

```javascript
const number = 1_234_567.89;
const germany = new Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE');
const ireland = new Intl.NumberFormat('ga-IE');
const france = new Intl.NumberFormat('fr-FR');

console.log('Germany: ' + germany.format(number));
console.log('Ireland: ' + ireland.format(number));
console.log('France: ' + france.format(number));
```

  </p>
</details>

## Formatting Currency

Fortunately, `Intl.NumberFormat` can do more than "numbers," it can handle **currency** when given a `Currency Code` option: (`{ style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }`)!

Now let's look at formatting across Euro locales:

- Germany: `1.234.567,89 €`
- Ireland: `€1,234,567.89`
- France: `1 234 567,89 €`

<details open>
  <summary>View source: JS currency formatting.</summary>
  <p>

```javascript
const number = 1_234_567.89;

const moneyFormatter = (locale, currency) => // helper function
  new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency });

const germany = moneyFormatter('de-DE', 'EUR');
const ireland = moneyFormatter('ga-IE', 'EUR');
const france = moneyFormatter('fr-FR', 'EUR');

console.log('Germany: ' + germany.format(number));
console.log('Ireland: ' + ireland.format(number));
console.log('France: ' + france.format(number));
```

  </p>
</details>

## Next Steps

Depending on your particular needs, you may want to explore a few related concepts:

- Best practices with user locale. Detect + allow overrides. (e.g. a country drop down.)
- Persisting whole integers (store cents, not dollars.)
- Money math. (e.g. applying a `20% off` coupon, calculating `subTotal + taxes`, etc.)
- Live exchange rates. (Interbank orders, forex/currency exchanges.)

## Recommendations

Some libraries can help with these tasks: 

**JavaScript / TypeScript**

- [dinero.js](https://v2.dinerojs.com/) supports money math, exchange rates, formatting, and parsing!

**Rust**

- [rusty_money](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_money) is my preferred Rust library.

**Go**

- [currency](https://github.com/bojanz/currency) is my current Golang choice.
