Is your company stuck? Maybe in full chaos? Or, just lacking in _hustle_?

No worries, the big boss has figured it out!

- It's culture! We need to read a book! Or, hire a consultant! Company offsite? Hawaii? _Sure!_
- It's values! _Embrace your new mandated values!_
- Actually, it's people's _perception_. Stupid people. Rebranding time!
- We forgot, we need to hire an adult. A `savior`! Someone who will fix everything. Someone from a real company, respected by friends & enemies alike. Someone who clearly spent a [pretentious amount of time on their website.](https://danlevy.net).
- The savior said we need to be data-driven. Duh, dummies. Now, we _drive data_ & make charts go up and to the right, brrr!
- Funny story, turns out it's the staff. `Fire key/random people.` _Let folks know we're serious._

  <p>Is your `<Insert Dept. Name>` in chaos?</p>

  <p>Was it the layoffs? (Err, _strategic adjustment._) No, no, it can't be that...</p>

  <p>Don't worry about causes, the company has a fix!</p>
  <p>Enter: A `savior`! Someone to fix everything!</p>
  
  <p><b>Spoiler:</b> It's always "data." The "fix" is (unironically) always Jira.</p>

  <h3>Book Decoder Ring</h3>

  The selection of a book club book says a lot about where a company's heading. It can be a way to set the tone for the next quarter, or telegraph imminent layoffs.

  Here's a handy cheat sheet to decode your company's book club selections:
