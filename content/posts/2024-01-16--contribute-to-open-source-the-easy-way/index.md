<!-- # How To: Contribute to Open Source -->

Do you want that Open Source Fast Life? Drippin‚Äô in donations? Rollin‚Äô in repos?

I‚Äôm going to share my exclusive - yet simple - approach which I‚Äôve used to successfully author countless PR‚Äôs across dozens of 10,000-Star repositories!

My small contributions can be seen in a range of projects from Node.js, Docker, Lodash, Bluebird, Gatsby, Rancher, Angular, React Router, Minio, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) and many more.

## Not The Way

Why is it difficult to **_`contribute`_** to Open Source?

I believe the main reason for this is virtually everyone gives terrible advice.

Have you heard about `‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù` labelled tickets?!?
While well-intentioned, in practice it‚Äôs a laughably subjective description which obscures an unknowable number of steps.

## Thinking Right

The Struggle is the Way: Every bit of open source software you‚Äôve ever struggled with (and overcome) is potentially your next ‚Äúeasy‚Äù contribution!

**By definition, you already solved the thing, most of the work is done.**

The real challenge is figuring out how to **help others avoid your struggle.**

Maybe a Tweet or Stack Overflow answer will do.

However, if you want the glory that lives forever: help others avoid your struggle in the first place.

## The Glory

The key thing to figure out is how your _dumb dumb_ brain got so lost.

- An outdated README? Missing or bad examples? Omitted setup steps? _Simple fix, include any missing info!_

- Did the API documentation not show up in your Google results. _Adjust or translate overly technical language._

- Perhaps it‚Äôs a technical oversight, and the docs site is missing necessary `<meta/>` tags. _Fix it if you know how, or write a ticket with your findings._

- If it's a skill issue, _propose adding appropriate links to relevant resources._

These types of issues are easy for maintainers to miss! And can have surprisingly big impact on the project & its users.

Think about it this way: how would you feel if you knew that sharing your fix might save 100‚Äôs (or 100,000‚Äôs) of devs from countless lost hours?

Next time you conquer some challenge, _don‚Äôt rebase away the evidence of your inadequacy!_
**Instead share your struggle & solution publicly!**

## The Fine Print

Always follow project guidelines, and never be an asshole. ‚ú®

It‚Äôs all public. So, be gracious, great, and grateful.

And if you need any more convincing: do Open Source for the learning! Experience new processes, languages, frameworks, automation!

Perhaps most importantly, you can **quickly advance your communication skills!**

The ability to advocate for your ideas can change your life!
