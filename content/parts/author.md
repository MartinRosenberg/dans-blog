Dan Levy is an accomplished programmer, teacher, speaker and cat dad.
<br /><br />

In his free time, Dan loves contributing back to the community! His personal Open Source work includes everything from the 'small': minor typos, 1-line changes (some with huge impact); as well 'big' contributions: feature development, security fix, documentation, or maintaining an OSS project.
<br /><br />

Some of Dan's documentation work is seen by countless developers visiting the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) site to learn about the Fetch & Promise APIs.
<br /><br />

His contributions span dozens of well-known projects, including [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org), [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby), [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/), [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird), [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash), [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher), [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio), [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), [IxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/IxJS), and [Functional Promises](https://github.com/functional-promises/functional-promises).
<br />

Attendees to Dan's (free) Open Source Workshops have also made 100's of their own contributions!
