Dan Levy is an accomplished programmer, teacher, speaker, cat dad, and leader.

In his free time, Dan loves contributing back to the community! His personal Open Source work includes everything from the 'small': minor typos, 1-line changes (some with huge impact); as well 'big' contributions: feature development, security fix, documentation, or maintaining an OSS project.

Some of Dan's documentation work is seen by countless developers visiting the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) site to learn about the Fetch & Promise API.

His contributions span dozens of well-known projects, including [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org), [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby), [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/), [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird), [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash), [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher), [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio), [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), [IxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/IxJS), and [Functional Promises](https://github.com/functional-promises/functional-promises).

Furthermore, Dan's (free) Open Source Workshops have helped 100's of developers with their first contribution!
